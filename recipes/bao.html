    <h1>Bao Buns</h1>
    <img src="../images/bao.jpeg" alt="Bao buns" height="300">
    <p>Fluffy, pillowy, and suspiciously cloud-like, bao buns are the edible equivalent of getting hugged by carbs. Whether you stuff them with pork, tofu, or that leftover chicken from last night, these soft steamed buns turn anything into comfort food. They're basically tacos if tacos were invented by a minimalist who loves warm hugs.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon instant yeast</li>
        <li>1/2 cup warm water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>Filling of choice (pork belly, tofu, chicken, or whatever’s lurking in your fridge)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the dough: Mix flour, sugar, salt, and yeast in a bowl. Add warm water and oil. Stir until it becomes a shaggy dough blob, then knead until smooth and elastic (about 10 minutes, or 7 if you're impatient).</li>
        <li>Let it rise: Cover the dough and let it sit in a warm spot for 1–2 hours, or until doubled in size. It’s basically taking a nap.</li>
        <li>Shape the buns: Roll the dough into small balls, then flatten into ovals. Fold each oval over a piece of parchment paper like a taco having an identity crisis.</li>
        <li>Steam the buns: Steam the folded dough over boiling water for 10 minutes. Don’t peek or they might get stage fright and deflate.</li>
        <li>Fill 'em up: Once steamed, pry them open gently (like a diary full of secrets) and fill with your choice of protein, veggies, and sauces.</li>
        <li>Serve & enjoy: Eat immediately while warm and fluffy. Optional: Brag to your friends that you made bao from scratch.</li>
    </ol>
