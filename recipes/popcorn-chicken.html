    <h1>Popcorn Chicken</h1>
    <img src="../images/chicken.jpeg" alt="popcorn chicken" height="500">
    <p>Popcorn chicken: because sometimes, you just want your meat bite-sized, crispy, and impossible to stop eating after the 12th piece. It's like regular chicken, but with a serious snack complex. Crunchy, golden, and dangerously addictive, it's the unofficial food of people who "accidentally" finish the whole batch.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 chicken breasts (cut into tiny, popcorn-worthy chunks)</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk (or milk + a splash of vinegar, if you're winging it)</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cornstarch (for that extra crunch)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>Oil for frying (a lot — don’t be shy)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Marinate the chicken: Toss your chicken chunks in buttermilk, cover, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Bonus points for overnight marinating.</li>
        <li>Prep the coating: In a bowl, mix flour, cornstarch, paprika, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. This is where the magic crunchy dust lives.</li>
        <li>Coat the chicken: Remove chicken from the buttermilk bath and coat each piece in the flour mixture. Shake off excess like you're gently waking it up.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil: In a deep pan, heat oil to 350°F (175°C). Use a thermometer, or toss in a breadcrumb and see if it sizzles like a reality TV feud.</li>
        <li>Fry it: Cook chicken in batches for 3–4 minutes until golden brown and cooked through. Don’t overcrowd — these nuggets need their space to shine.</li>
        <li>Drain & serve: Remove with a slotted spoon, drain on paper towels, and serve hot with your favorite dipping sauce. Regret nothing.</li>
    </ol>
